# The Origin of Life
Radioactive dating estimates an origin of the earth at 4.8 billion years ago.

All living organisms are composed mostly of water, and the rest (dry weight) is made up of C, H, O, N, P and S.

## Chemical Evolution
The first biomolecules would have arisen because of abiotic synthesis of small molecules. This could have been due to ultraviolet right or lightning. This was replicated in an experiment by Miller and Urey.

Macromolecules, like cellulose, were formed by spontaneous polymerisation due to a high rate of dehydration.

Molecules like RNA and DNA then arose, which have the property of self-replication.

Protobionts formed by aggregation of abiotically synthesised molecules for maintenance of internal environment. They assembled as liposomes, which are amphipathic.

## The Oxygen Revolution

# Evolution
Lamarck was one of the first to describe the concept of evolution, although his theories were later disproved. They were based on the use or disuse of organs.

Charles Darwin then came up with a new theory based on his observations in the Galapagos Islands. He suggested that the differences within a species (called *variations*) are inheritable, and that species could adapt to changing environments through these variations. He also noted that competition among individuals in a population for a resource altered their chances for survival depending on their individual traits.  
Darwin and Wallace, in 1859, claimed that every species is descended from another one with modifications, and the pressure which brings about these modifications is the environment the organisms live in. This pressure was termed *natural selection*.  
An example of this was noted by J. W. Tutt in England during the Industrial Revolution – light-coloured moths initially were in majority, but were outnumbered by dark-coloured ones in about 90 years, as they had a survival advantage.

## Types of Natural Selection
Organisms adapt in three ways:

* stabilising
* directional: extreme outliers have an advantage
* diversifying: two populations arise from one due to conditions like continental drift

There are two common features: the environment provides selection pressure, and certain individuals adapt to the change.

## Mendelian Genetics
Darwin did not explain the molecular mechanism of the variations that he noted, and the basis for their inheritance.
